## Description
This is update #1 to my responsive portfolio. I designed this website in such a way that it would render well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. I hope to be able to use this website one day to showcase all of my web applications, provide a basic profile of me, and give others a place to contact me.

I tried to build this website by implementing only Bootstrap classes as much as I could.

## Updated Portfolio

üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources for online presence](hhttps://sites.google.com/2u.com/careerservices-webdev/coding-milestones/milestone-polish-online-presence).

Your updated portfolio should contain the following:

1. Your full name

2. Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

3. A link to a PDF of your resume

4. A list of 3-5 projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

    * Project title

    * Link to the deployed version

    * Link to the GitHub repository

    * Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Ensure that your portfolio is free of grammar and spelling mistakes

#### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile

Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. If you haven't yet, now is the time to update the following in your GitHub profile:

1. Professional profile picture

   * A photo or an image other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)

2. Biography

3. Your current location

4. Email address

5. Link to your portfolio

6. Pin 3-6 repositories that you want to highlight

   * Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

   * Click "Customize your pins"

   * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

   * Make sure each of these projects is deployed and add a link to the deployed project in their README files

7. Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

8. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

   * Title of app
   * Live link to deployed app
   * List of technologies used
   * 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is
   * 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app
   * License (usually MIT)
   * Contact information for you and any collaborators

9. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits

### 3. Updated Resume

üíÅ Need help building a resume? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources](https://sites.google.com/2u.com/careerservices-webdev/coding-milestones/milestone-develop-your-resume).

Submit a clear, concise and compelling resume, tailored to the type of job you‚Äôre looking for.

Your resume should include:

* a heading with your name, phone number, professional email address, links to LinkedIn, portfolio and GitHub

* technical skills section, with all programming languages and technologies listed

* 3 of your strongest projects/homework assignments with brief description, languages used, and URL

### 4. Updated LinkedIn Profile

üíÅ Need help updating your LinkedIn? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources for online presence](hhttps://sites.google.com/2u.com/careerservices-webdev/coding-milestones/milestone-polish-online-presence).

Update your LinkedIn Profile with a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github and portfolio.
